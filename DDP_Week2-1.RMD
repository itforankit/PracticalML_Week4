```

## My Map

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r MyMap, echo=TRUE}
# initiate the leaflet instance and store it to a variable
m = leaflet()
    
# we want to add map tiles so we use the addTiles() function - the default is openstreetmap
m = addTiles(m)
    
# we can add markers by using the addMarkers() function
m = addMarkers(m, lng=77.2295, lat=28.6129, popup="T")
    
# we can "run"/compile the map, by running the printing it
m
```
